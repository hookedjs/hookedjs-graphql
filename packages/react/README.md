# Dombro React Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate meant to be used as a demonstration of bleeding edge or a foundation for my next project.

## Current Features

- Typescript Type-strict
- Uses react-scripts (CRA) for easy tooling and super-low config
- Slim: All libraries carefully chosen and/or avoided to minimize bundle size
- Opinionated: folder and code structure are highly consistent to make the codebase easy to navigate and encouraging of code-splitting / progressive loading patterns
- SEOed: Easy management of page meta   
- Scroll Position tracking and restoration on browser back/forward
- Bundle analyzer: webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Routing: React Router v6
- Forms: react-hook-forms
- Webpack: Easily customize using react-app-rewired
- Context-based State management (no dependencies!)
- Mock API for Authentication based on common patterns, to demonstrate server side validation and make the auth patterns more realistic. 
- Dead browser warning via outdated-browser-rework

Coming soon:

- Change from route-based to feature-based folder structure
- Preact-router for smaller bundles
- Consider dropping form libraries to save KBs
- Consider dropping SEO libraries to save KBs
